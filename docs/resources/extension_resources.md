## Official Extension Platform
The official extension platform, [`extensions.blender.org`](https://extensions.blender.org), implements stringent guidelines to ensure the quality of published extensions.

- [General Guidelines](https://developer.blender.org/docs/handbook/extensions/addon_guidelines/) (**Official**): All platform extensions _must_ conform to this.
- [Moderation Guidelines](https://developer.blender.org/docs/features/extensions/moderation/guidelines/) (**Official**): Checklist used by extension moderators when approving extensions.
- [Canned Moderation Responses](https://developer.blender.org/docs/features/extensions/moderation/canned_responses/) (**Official**): A very specific list of things that are not acceptable on the extensions platform.
- [Become a Moderator](https://developer.blender.org/docs/features/extensions/moderation/): Help extensions reach users faster.

**We strongly suggest** playing "moderator of your own extension" before attempting to publish to the platform.
