# Getting Started

## Running `blext`
If you have `uv`, just run:

```bash
uvx blext
```

This relies on [`uv` tools](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/tools/), which is similar to `pipx`.

This is the recommended way of using `blext`.

## Using `blext`
For now, see `examples/simple` in this repository for an example of a working Blender extension.

Particular attention should be paid to the `[tool.blext]` section of `pyproject.toml`.

More in-depth documentation TBD.
